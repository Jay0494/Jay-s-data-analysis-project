### Project Overview
This is a real project which provides an analysis of car sales data from an American car sales business with the goal to determine the most profitable and highest-selling car models. This report includes the top 10 selling car models by revenue, the bottom 10 selling car models, and the top 10 profitable car models by profit. Based on these findings, recommendations and next steps are suggested to guide future sales strategies.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is private and cannot be shared. 

### Tools 

- Powerbi - Used for data visualization
- Power query - Used for data cleaning

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation stage, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection. 
2. Handling missing values.
3. Removing duplicates.
4. Standardization and normalization of data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
I explored the data to answer the key business questions such as:
1. What are the top 10 selling car Models(by revenue)
2. What are to 10 lowest selling car models (by revenue)
3. What are the 10p 10 most profitable car models 

### Results 
The financial overview reveals a total revenue of $11,968,694.69, a total profit of $1,758,133.80, and total expenses of $15,977.00. Key insights include:

1. **Hyundai Tucson's Dominance**: Various model years of the Hyundai Tucson (2016, 2017, 2018) consistently lead in both revenue and profit, highlighting its strong market performance.
2. **Luxury Models' Potential**: High-priced models like the Land Rover Discovery and Audi Q7 demonstrate good revenue and profit margins, indicating a lucrative niche market.
3. **Older Models Underperformance**: Pre-2015 models are among the lowest sellers, suggesting a need to consider phasing them out due to low demand.
4. **Profitability vs. Sales Volume**: Certain models, such as the Ford Fusion, achieve profitability despite lower sales volumes, potentially due to lower costs of goods sold (COGS) or high-margin opportunities.

### Recommendations
To optimize sales and profitability, the following strategies are recommended:

1. **Focus on High Revenue Models**: Increase inventory and marketing for the highly profitable 2016 and 2017 Hyundai Tucson models.
2. **Reevaluate Low Performing Models**: Assess the bottom 10 selling models for discontinuation or strategies to boost their sales.
3. **Profit Maximization**: Explore ways to enhance sales of high-margin models like the Land Rover Discovery and Nissan Pathfinder.
4. **Inventory Management**: Maintain adequate inventory levels for high-demand models to avoid stockouts and overstocking.
5. **Targeted Promotions**: Implement targeted promotions to improve sales of both high-margin and underperforming models.

### Next Steps
1. **Detailed Market Analysis**: Conduct a thorough market analysis to anticipate demand trends for the next year.
2. **Customer Feedback**: Analyze customer feedback to understand the factors behind the success of top-performing models.
3. **Competitive Pricing Strategy**: Adjust pricing strategies to maximize profitability for both high and low-selling models.
4. **Expand Marketing Efforts**: Use data-driven insights to increase marketing for high-selling and profitable models.
5. **Quarterly Review**: Establish a quarterly review process to monitor and adjust sales strategies as needed.

### Limitations 
I excluded all zero values from my sales column to ensure the accuracy of my conclusions.
